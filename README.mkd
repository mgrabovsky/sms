This is a silly little utility written from urgent need thereof. For some reason,
I figured it would be faster to reinvent the wheel than to search for an existing,
robust solution.

## Requirements

-   Python 3

## Set up

Written for and tested with Python 3.7 and later.

```sh
$ python setup.py # Create the database
```

## Usage

For regular updates, add `@daily ~/sms/notifier.py` to your crontab.

```sh
$ echo '@daily python3 $HOME/sms/notifier.py' | crontab
```

A separate execution script might be necessary if you're using `virtualenv`. See
`runner.hs` for an example

```sh
@daily $HOME/sms/runner.sh
```

## To-do list of features

- [x] diffs
- [ ] proper error handling and recovery
- [ ] proper logging
- [ ] parallelism
- [ ] templating (jinja2?)
- [ ] aggregated mailing
